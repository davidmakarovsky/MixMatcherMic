# MixMatcherMic
This project works by recording through a microphone sensor on a makerboard. Then, using arduino, the microphone data is sent through serial to a python script. This python script uses libraries and buttons read by arduino to add autotune, remove background noise, or both. Additionally, there is an LED that signals when the microphone is recording audio.
